[25 Aug. 2024 Update Note: Improved version with regular web app UI but without Telugu: https://gita-rsi.vercel.app/ ] 

Small Next.js program that uses Apollo Client to retrieve Bhagavad Gita chapter summaries from a GraphQL endpoint: https://gql.bhagavadgita.io/graphql (Explorer: https://gql.bhagavadgita.io/graphiql), and displays it to user. The program was enhanced to use Bhagavad Gita Telugu chapter summaries hard coded in an array of objects.

The article [Getting Started With Apollo Client in Next.js](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/next-js-getting-started) was very useful to write this small program.
